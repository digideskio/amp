  ---- Hackable service state management
       for your OSX development environment.

  Synopsis
  --------
  Amp starts, stops, restarts and reloads configured services independent from
  init.d or any other operating system specific service management daemon. Amp
  is hackable in that it lets you directly add and manipulate services and their
  options without needing to deal with elaborate syntaxes of sophisticated
  service managment systems.
